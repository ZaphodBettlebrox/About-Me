      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello my name is Aidan and I have just started a coding bootcamp at the the University of Washington. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Santa Barbra, California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to 3d model and print props, wash or work on my car, go on drives in my wrx, and listen to music. I also like to hike, workout,
         and hangout with close friends</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to be able to be self employed and work from home.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Tacoma, Washington</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The technology industry is ever growing and tech companies are needing more and more coders, having to hire from outside the US.
         This is due to not enough people in the US pursuing a career in these fields. Not only that, but you make a lot of money coding.</p>
