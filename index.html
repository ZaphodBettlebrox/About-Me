      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello my name is Aidan and I have just started a coding bootcamp at the the University of Washington. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Born in Santa Maria, California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to 3d model and print props, wash or work on my car, go on drives, and listen to music. I also like to hike, workout,
         and hangout with close friends</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to be able to be self employed and work from home.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Tacoma, Washington</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The technology industry is ever growing and tech companies are needing more and more coders. These companies are having to hire from
        outside the United States due to not enough people in the US pursuing a career in these fields. For someone to be able to code and
        be already living near one of the largest tech areas, there will be plenty of job opportunities for great companies.</p>
